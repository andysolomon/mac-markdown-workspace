# PRD-to-Plan Mode

Load this when the source is a PRD and the requested output is an implementation plan, not new issues.

## Source handling

Confirm the PRD is available from conversation, file, or linked issue. If unavailable, ask for a file path, issue number, URL, or pasted PRD.

## Planning approach

Identify durable architectural decisions before slicing:

- route structures / URL patterns
- database schema shape
- key data models
- auth approach
- third-party service boundaries
- test strategy

Draft tracer-bullet phases: each phase should deliver a narrow but complete path through relevant layers and be demoable or verifiable on its own.

## Output file

Write to:

```text
./plans/<feature>.md
```

unless the user specifies another path.

Also create synchronized in-flight artifacts under `docs/` using a kebab-case slug from the feature name:

- `docs/<feature-slug>-IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `docs/<feature-slug>-progress.txt`

Follow `arc-implementation-plan-progress/references/output-contract.md`. Initialize progress with:

```bash
mkdir -p docs
arc-implementation-plan-progress/scripts/init_progress_txt.sh \
  docs/<feature-slug>-IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md \
  docs/<feature-slug>-progress.txt
```

## Format

# Plan: <Feature Name>

> Source PRD: <identifier or link>
